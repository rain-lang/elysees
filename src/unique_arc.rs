/// An `Arc` that is known to be uniquely owned
///
/// When `Arc`s are constructed, they are known to be
/// uniquely owned. In such a case it is safe to mutate
/// the contents of the `Arc`. Normally, one would just handle
/// this by mutating the data on the stack before allocating the
/// `Arc`, however it's possible the data is large or unsized
/// and you need to heap-allocate it earlier in such a way
/// that it can be freely converted into a regular `Arc` once you're
/// done.
///
/// `UniqueArc` exists for this purpose, when constructed it performs
/// the same allocations necessary for an `Arc`, however it allows mutable access.
/// Once the mutation is finished, you can call `.shareable()` and get a regular `Arc`
/// out of it.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use elysees::UniqueArc;
/// let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
/// let mut x = UniqueArc::new(data);
/// x[4] = 7; // mutate!
/// let y = x.shareable(); // y is an Arc<T>
/// ```
